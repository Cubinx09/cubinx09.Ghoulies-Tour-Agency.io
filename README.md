# Ghoulies Tour Agency
Touring agency dedicated to the haunted and frightening. Ain't that scary? We'll do you one better, all of our employees are horror monsters from all over the world... If you want to travel, but see the spookiest places the vacation spot has to offer, we got your back!

Real silly one here, it's a company website although customization is done through pure CSS instead of using something like bootstrap, because I found the idea of relearning it to be too daunting. So there's no real sleekness here but I mean, you can only go up from here right? No javascript to be found either, I have next to zero knowledge of how it works (even though I should).

I had to look up a couple already existing touring agency websites to get the gist on how i should make the website work and I think I did a pretty fine job. Most company websites share the same formula so it wasn't hard to pick up on what made a website look like it came from a company.

Making the layout, especially all the images, fit in was quite a bit of a challenge. Loads of trial and error to make everything look passable.

The pictures (except the drawings, those were made by me!) come from google images, normally the top result.

The total time for this project is 6h 24m.
